# Teams Time Tracker SaaS 3T's


3T's is a user-friendly time tracking SaaS built with Python Django, HTML, VueJS, and Bulma CSS. The platform offers secure user authentication with simple Vue validation and three different plans: Free, Basic, and Pro.

The customised dashboard panel provides users with a comprehensive overview of their daily tasks, monthly projects, and untracked entries. Users can easily navigate through their tasks with the help of back and next-day buttons.

Moreover, the platform allows users to view a list of projects with registered time spent on each project, along with the number of open tasks or to-do's. Clicking on a project takes the user to a detailed view of the project containing a list of tasks/todos with registered time. Users can also add their time spent on each task.

The user account dashboard offers users the ability to edit their personal details and add a new team. Users can view a list of teams they belong to and switch between them. Additionally, team owners can make a team active at a specific time and invite other users to join the team.

The team detail view displays the current plan, end date, and possible autorenewal options. Here, users can easily upgrade or cancel their plan, view a list of invited users, and invite new users to join the team.

Finally, users can start tracking their time for a project at any time. If they need to stop, the platform redirects them to a project track entry view where they can confirm the project details, task, and time.

In summary, 3T's is an efficient and easy-to-use platform for managing time and tasks.
